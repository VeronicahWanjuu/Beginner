My first readme
# Project Overview

This repository, `alu-zero_day`, is designed to help you get hands-on experience with Git and GitHub. It includes various coding tasks, branch management, and collaboration exercises. The project structure includes directories for different types of files and examples of common Git workflows.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain source code management.
- Understand what Git and GitHub are, and their differences.
- Create and manage a repository.
- Write effective README files.
- Perform basic Git operations: commit, push, pull, and branch management.
- Collaborate effectively using Git.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Repo-Session
- Created a new directory called `git` in the `alu-zero_day` repository.
- Added a non-empty `README.md` at the root of the repository and inside the `git` directory.

### 2. Coding Fury Road
- Created directories: `bash`, `c`, `js`.
- Added files with specific content:
  - `c/c_is_fun.c`
  - `js/main.js`
  - `js/index.js`
  - `bash/best` with content:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Best"
    ```
  - `bash/school` with content:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "School"
    ```
- Committed and pushed these changes with the message: “Starting to code today, so cool”.

### 3. Collaboration
- **Branch:** `update_script`
  - Created an empty file `bash/98`.
  - Updated `bash/best` to output "Best School".
  - Updated `bash/school` to output "The school is open!".
  - Committed changes with the message: “My personal work” and pushed the branch.

- **Hot Fix:**
  - **Branch:** `main`
  - Updated `bash/best` to output "This School is so cool!".
  - Deleted the `js` directory.
  - Committed changes with the message: “Hot fix” and pushed to origin.

### 4. Collaboration: Be Up to Date
- Updated `README.md` from GitHub.com.
- Created a file `up_to_date` with the command used to update:
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
